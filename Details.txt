How Dart Runs:
    Dart can run in two main ways:
        1- Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation → For fast native mobile/desktop apps
            AOT means the Dart code is compiled to native machine code before the app is run.
            Where is AOT Used?
                - In production builds
                - When you create a release app for Android, iOS, Windows, etc.
        2- Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation → Used in development for hot reload
            JIT stands for Just-in-Time compilation. Dart code is compiled at runtime, 
            while the app is running.
            Where is JIT Used?
                - During development
                - When you're using Flutter hot reload or hot restart
    In this repo:
        Your Dart programs run in JIT mode (standard run) and later understand AOT conceptually
        for future use (When You Shift to Flutter).
